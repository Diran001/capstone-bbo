# Black-Box Bayesian Optimisation (BBO) Capstone

## Overview

This repository contains my capstone work on Black-Box Bayesian Optimisation. The task is to optimise eight unknown black-box functions whose analytical forms are not observable. Information about each function is obtained only through interaction with the course portal: an input vector is submitted and a corresponding score is returned.

A key practical constraint of the capstone is that only one new query per function may be submitted each week. As a result, each candidate point must be selected carefully. The workflow in this repository is therefore designed to support reproducibility, traceability, and transparent justification of optimisation choices across successive rounds.

## Research objective

The objective of this repository is to document and support a repeatable optimisation workflow for sparse, sequential, black-box evaluation under a strict submission budget. The repository provides an organised environment for:

- maintaining cumulative observations for each function
- generating weekly portal-ready candidate inputs
- registering returned outputs
- tracking progress across rounds
- supporting transparent explanation of modelling and selection logic

The repository is intended as a research-focused capstone environment rather than as a general-purpose optimisation library.

## What the notebook uses

The live notebook is `notebooks/CapStone_BBO_Workflow.ipynb`.

It works from the repository root and uses these main folders:

- `data/initial_data/` for cumulative function datasets
- `data/submissions/` for weekly portal-ready inputs and returned outputs
- `data/processed/` for manually downloaded portal return folders
- `data/plots/` for progress charts
- `data/logs/` for execution logs

Processed week folders follow this convention:

- `data/processed/Capstone_Project_WeekXXSubmissionProcessed/`

## Weekly workflow

1. Start from the current cumulative data in `data/initial_data/`.
2. Run `notebooks/CapStone_BBO_Workflow.ipynb`.
3. Generate the next portal-ready `inputs.txt`.
4. Submit one new query per function to the portal.
5. When the returned results arrive, place the processed folder under `data/processed/`.
6. Copy or register the returned `outputs.txt` into `data/submissions/week_XX/outputs.txt`.
7. Run the notebook again for the next cycle.

## Technical approach

The current workflow uses a Gaussian Process surrogate per function with acquisition-based candidate selection. In practical terms, the notebook uses:

- scikit-learn Gaussian Process regression
- a Matérn kernel with explicit noise handling
- acquisition rules such as Expected Improvement, Probability of Improvement, and Upper Confidence Bound
- large random candidate sampling to approximate the best next point in the bounded search space

This is a good fit for the capstone because the data is sparse and the evaluation budget is tight.

## Helper scripts

Run scripts from the repository root, for example:

```cmd
.\scripts\cap_scr_v010_week.cmd check 8
.\scripts\cap_scr_v010_status.cmd
.\scripts\cap_scr_v010_copy_processed_outputs.cmd 8
```

`cap_scr_v010_archive_zips.cmd` is an optional maintenance utility, not part of the normal weekly flow.

## Notes

This is the main public entry point for the repository. Supporting write-ups are kept in `docs/`.

## Research context

This repository is maintained as a research-focused capstone environment for Black-Box Bayesian Optimisation. It emphasises reproducibility, function-specific tuning, historical comparison across rounds, and transparent experimental workflow design.
